"Symbolic PathFinder (SPF) combines symbolic execution with model checking and constraint solving for test case generation. In this tool, programs are executed on symbolic inputs representing multiple concrete inputs. Values of variables are represented as numeric constraints, generated from analysis of the code structure. These constraints are then solved to generate test inputs guaranteed to reach that part of code. Essentially SPF performs symbolic execution for Java programs at the bytecode level. Symbolic PathFinder uses the analysis engine of the Ames JPF model checking tool (i.e. jpf-core)."
