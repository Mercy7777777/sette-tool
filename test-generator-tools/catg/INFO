"CATG is a concolic unit testing engine for Java programs.  The implementation uses ASM for instrumentation. ASM instrumentation instruments (see janala.instrument.*) class files at runtime and dumps (see janala.logger.*) to a file a log of all instructions executed by the program and all values loaded from local stacks and heaps. A concolic execution engine (see janala.interpreters.*) then takes the log and performs both symbolic and concrete interpretation of the logged instructions."
